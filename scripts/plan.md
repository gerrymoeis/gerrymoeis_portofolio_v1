# Windows XP Portfolio Project Plan

## Notes
- Target audience: recruiters, HR, freelance clients, fellow developers; focus is on job/internship applications.
- Desired impression: creative, out-of-the-box, humorous, stand-out; "Wow" factor is essential.
- Success metrics: job offers, recruiter contacts, freelance requests, donations, sponsors, and personal pride.
- MVP focus: robust, comprehensive, and suitable design system & UI components.
- Emphasize modular, base-style UI components for flexible experimentation and easy editing in Windows XP style.
- Maintain a comprehensive, detailed project vision document (markdown), capturing all user answers, design/UX decisions, and requirements for future reference and use with MCP Server Context7.
- Documentation must be highly detailed; split into multiple markdown files if needed to ensure all context, Q&A, and design/UX/user flow decisions are preserved for future reference.
- MVP features: Desktop with icons, Taskbar & Start Menu for navigation, draggable/resizable windows for "apps" (Notepad, Folder, Command Prompt), and interactive user flows (e.g., About Me window on load, large icon project display, creative About/Contact presentation).
- All windows/components should be draggable and mimick real XP OS interactivity.
- User approved further research into open-source Next.js CMS with Supabase integration.
- Decision made: Strapi selected as Headless CMS for the project (open-source, mature, Next.js compatible, supports Supabase integration).
- Font decision: 'Tiny5' (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tiny5?query=pixel) chosen as primary pixel font for UI. Import instructions and CSS class to be included in project documentation.
- Technical preferences: Use Supabase for database; open to blog, contact, donate, sponsor features; Headless CMS should be simple, open-source, free, and compatible with Supabase if used.
- Awaiting further discussion on best admin CMS approach (headless or not).

## Task List
- [x] Complete comprehensive boilerplate analysis
- [x] Collect initial project description from user
- [ ] Conduct detailed Q&A to gather requirements (in progress)
- [ ] Interpret and document user's feature/UX answers into project notes/spec (ensure all Q&A and design/UX/user flow details are fully captured and structured in the project vision doc; split into multiple markdown files if needed)
- [x] Advise on admin CMS options (headless vs non-headless, open source, Supabase integration)
- [x] Research and recommend headless CMS options (excluding Reddit link; must be open-source, free, simple, and compatible with Supabase)
- [x] Provide comparative recommendation: build admin dashboard from scratch vs. use headless CMS (recommendation: use Strapi Headless CMS)
- [x] Research and recommend more retro/pixel open-source fonts for Windows XP UI (decision: use Tiny5)
- [ ] Research and recommend XP-style pixel icon libraries/UI assets
- [ ] Research animation/UI inspiration and libraries (e.g., Framer Motion) suitable for XP-style interactivity
- [ ] Draft initial project specification & feature list
- [ ] Plan technical architecture and design system
- [ ] Begin implementation (after planning finalized)

## Current Goal
Continue requirements Q&A and CMS discussion
